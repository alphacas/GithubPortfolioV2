Take your Github username and some Linkedin downloads and instantly convert it into a solid portfolio website! This is version 2 of the original Github Portfolio project by Robert West, Tim Baker, and Edmund He. It converts the original project into NextJS13 with the app directory and React server components, and containerizes the project using Docker and Docker Compose. The project uses popular infrastructure technologies; it is reverse-proxied with NGINX and hosted on AWS EC2.
